Changes made:
- Standardized fonts across all pages: font-family: "Segoe UI", Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;
- Responsive design applied (mobile, tablet, desktop support).
- Unified navbar across all pages with a mobile-friendly dropdown (hamburger).
- Navbar dropdown stays open until the hamburger is tapped again.
- Spacing standardized for consistency.
- CSS kept human-readable for easy editing.

Note: All images remain untouched in original quality.

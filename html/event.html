          <li>Aptech's 25th Anniversary Celebration:
            <ul>
              <li>(Celebrated in conjunction with the 17th Career Quest, September 2025). This milestone was celebrated
                across the various Career Quest venues, with a significant announcement that Aptech has trained over

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Key Takeaways:
            <ul>
              <li>Aptech's major events are primarily the annual Career Quest and its global competitions like TechWiz.
              </li>
              <li>The company's marketing and public relations focus on the impact and ventures of these events (e.g.,
                scholarships, university partnerships) rather than on creating a publicly accessible historical calendar
                of every single event.
              </li>
              <li>Lagos is a primary hub for Aptech's operations in Nigeria, and its various centers (e.g., Maryland,
                Lekki, Ikeja, Festac Town) frequently serve as venues for these events.
              </li>
              <li>The specific dates and venues for events prior to 2022 are not easily found in detailed historical
                records online. The information available typically refers to them in a general, aggregated sense.</li>
